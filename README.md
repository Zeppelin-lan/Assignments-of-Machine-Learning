For the first assignment:
The target is to build a model to estimate the profit of restaurants by the population of a city to by Linear Regression
The steps:
1: Load the data set.
2: Visualize the data.
3: Compute cost and implementate the cost function.
4:Compute gradient and implementate the step function of gradient descent.
5:Learning parameters using batch gradient descent.
6:Predict the profits in different population of cities.
