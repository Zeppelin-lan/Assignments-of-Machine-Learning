# Assignments-of-Machine-Learning  
It's assignments of Machine learning in Laurentian University  
Assignments of Yalong Lan.  
My student number is: 0439411  

For the first assignment:  
The target is to build a model to estimate the profit of restaurants by the population of a city to by Linear Regression  
The steps:  
1: Load the data set.  
2: Visualize the data.  
3: Compute cost and implementate the cost function.  
4:Compute gradient and implementate the step function of gradient descent.  
5:Learning parameters using batch gradient descent.  
6:Predict the profits in different population of cities.  

For the sceond assignment:  
Use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits 0-9.  
Exercise 1: create a NumPy implementation for the softmax function.  
Exercise 2: Use Keras Sequential model and Dense Layer with a ReLU activation to construct the three layer network described in exercise 1.  
steps:  
1.Create a NumPy implementation for the softmax function.  
2.load dataset.  
3.View the variables and check the dimensions.  
4.Visualizing the Data  
5. Model representation  
6. Tensorflow Model Implementation  
7. Softmax placement  
8. Use Keras Sequential model and Dense Layer with a ReLU activation to construct the three layer network described in exercise 1  
9. examine the weights to verify that tensorflow produced the same dimensions as we calculated above.  
10. examine the loss   
11. make a prediction  

For the third assignment:  
Implement a decision tree from scratch and apply it to the task of classifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.  
Steps:  
1.Check the dataset.  
2.Calculate entropy function.  
3.Split dataset.  
4.Get best split.  
5.Building the tree.  

For the forth assignment:  
Implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression.  
steps:  
1.Finding closest centroids  
2.Computing centroid means  
3.K-means on a sample dataset  
4.Random initialization  
5.Image compression with K-means
